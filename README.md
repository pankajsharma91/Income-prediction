we have to develop an ML model to predict the income of any person based on the 11 parameters like Age,sex, education level,marital status, occupation ,relationship status,
race,sex,capital gain,capital loss,perhour working, native etc.

we have to evaluate the already available data and classify the test data if it falls in greater then/less then/equal to the 50k income group.
